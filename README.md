# 📁 Task Submission Folder – Plagiarism Review

This folder contains submissions from students who were previously flagged for plagiarism.

The tasks in this folder are **closely related to the original marked assignments**, but have been **re-created and completed in class under supervision** to test the students' **understanding of the core concepts**.

These tasks are:

* Assessed by the instructor (me) directly.
* Designed to evaluate **individual comprehension** and **honest effort**.
* Used as a measure to determine whether the student has gained a genuine grasp of the topics despite the earlier misconduct.

> **Note:** These are not the original submissions. They serve as a second chance opportunity for demonstrating knowledge in a fair and guided environment.
